	abstract = {Sex differences exist in behaviors, disease and neuropsychiatric disorders. Sexual dimorphisms however, have yet to be studied across the whole brain and across a comprehensive time course of postnatal development. Here, we use manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) to longitudinally image male and female C57BL/6J mice across 9 time points, beginning at postnatal day 3. We recapitulate findings on canonically dimorphic areas, demonstrating MEMRI's ability to study neuroanatomical sex differences. We discover, upon whole-brain volume correction, that neuroanatomical regions larger in males develop earlier than those larger in females. Groups of areas with shared sexually dimorphic developmental trajectories reflect behavioral and functional networks, and expression of genes involved with sex processes. Also, post-pubertal neuroanatomy is highly individualized, and individualization occurs earlier in males. Our results demonstrate the ability of MEMRI to reveal comprehensive developmental differences between male and female brains, which will improve our understanding of sex-specific predispositions to various neuropsychiatric disorders.},

High resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging makes it possible to study in vivo changes in the hippocampus over time and is useful for comparing hippocampal volume and structure in wild type and mutant mice. Such comparisons demand a reliable way to segment the hippocampal formation. We have developed a method for the systematic segmentation of the hippocampal formation using the perfusion-fixed C57BL/6 mouse brain for application in longitudinal and comparative studies. Our aim was to develop a guide for segmenting over 40 structures in an adult mouse brain using 30 $\mu$m isotropic resolution images acquired with a 16.4 T MR imaging system and combined using super-resolution reconstruction.},

	abstract = {a r t i c l e i n f o The neocortex is the largest component of the mammalian cerebral cortex. It integrates sensory inputs with experiences and memory to produce sophisticated responses to an organism's internal and external environment. While areal patterning of the mouse neocortex has been mapped using histological techniques, the neocortex has not been comprehensively segmented in magnetic resonance images. This study presents a method for systematic segmentation of the C57BL/6J mouse neocortex. We created a minimum deformation atlas, which was hierarchically segmented into 74 neocortical and cortical-related regions, making it the most detailed atlas of the mouse neocortex currently available. In addition, we provide mean volumes and relative intensities for each structure as well as a nomenclature comparison between the two most cited histological atlases of the mouse brain. This MR atlas is available for download, and it should enable researchers to perform automated segmentation in genetic models of cortical disorders. Introduction The neocortex is the largest component of the telencephalon in the mouse. The histology of neocortical areas, typically composed of six layers of neurons, distinguishes them from the olfactory cortical areas (which contain only three distinct layers) and from the hippo-campal regions. Large areas of the mouse neocortex serve as primary receiving areas for somatosensory, visual, auditory, vestibular, taste, and visceral sensations. Cortical areas subserving motor function are also relatively large, and are located rostral to the somatosensory cortex. The remainder of the mouse neocortex comprises the orbitofrontal, the cingulate/retrosplenial, and the parietal association cortical areas. Segmentation of the mouse neocortex is challenging, but there are obvious transitions between many of the functionally distinct regions. Taken together, the many histological and electrophysiological studies of mouse cortex over the past century reveal a clear picture of areal patterning (Kirkcaldie, 2012). These studies have been based},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of autism populations is confounded by the inherent heterogeneity in the individuals' genetics and environment, two factors difficult to control for. Imaging genetic animal models that recapitulate a mutation associated with autism quantify the impact of genetics on brain morphology and mitigate the confounding factors in human studies. Here, we used MRI to image three genetic mouse models with single mutations implicated in autism: Neuroligin-3 R451C knock-in, Methyl-CpG binding protein-2 (MECP2) 308-truncation and integrin $\beta$3 homozygous knockout. This study identified the morphological differences specific to the cerebellum, a structure repeatedly linked to autism in human neuroimaging and postmortem studies. To accomplish a comparative analysis, a segmented cerebellum template was created and used to segment each study image. This template delineated 39 different cerebellar structures. For Neuroligin-3 R451C male mutants, the gray (effect size (ES) = 1.94, FDR q = 0.03) and white (ES = 1.84, q = 0.037) matter of crus II lobule and the gray matter of the paraflocculus (ES = 1.45, q = 0.045) were larger in volume. The MECP2 mutant mice had cerebellar volume changes that increased in scope depending on the genotype: hemizygous males to homozygous females. The integrin $\beta$3 mutant mouse had a drastically smaller cerebellum than controls with 28 out of 39 cerebellar structures smaller. These imaging results are discussed in relation to repetitive behaviors, sociability, and learning in the context of autism. This work further illuminates the cerebellum's role in autism.},

Individual scans were normalized, registered, and averaged into one volume. Structures within the cerebrum, cere-bellum, and brainstem were painted on each slice of the average MR image while using simultaneous viewing of the coronal, sagittal and horizontal orientations. The final product, which will be freely available to the research community, provides the most detailed MR-based, three-dimensional neuroanatomical atlas of the whole brain yet created. The atlas is furthermore accompanied by ancillary detailed descriptions of boundaries for each structure and provides high quality neuroanato-mical details pertinent to MR studies using mouse models in research.},

	abstract = {The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using the AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.},

	abstract = {The great promise of comparative neuroscience is to understand why brains differ by investigating the relations between variations in the organization of different brains, their evolutionary history, and their current ecological niche. For this approach to be successful, the organization of different brains needs to be quantifiable. Here, we present an approach to formally comparing the connectivity of different cortical areas across different brains. We exploit the fact that cortical regions can be characterized by the unique pattern of connectivity, the so-called connectivity fingerprint. By comparing connectivity fingerprints between cortical areas in the human and non-human primate brain we can identify between-species homologs, but also illustrate that is driving differences between species. We illustrate the approach by comparing the organization of the frontal cortex between humans and macaques, showing general similarities combined with some differences in the lateral frontal pole.},

@article{Mars2018_2,
	abstract = {Fifteen years ago, Passingham and colleagues proposed that brain areas can be described in terms of their unique pattern of input and output connections with the rest of the brain, and that these connections are a crucial determinant of their function. We explore how the advent of neuroimaging of connectivity has allowed us to test and extend this proposal. We show that describing the brain in terms of an abstract connectivity space, as opposed to physical locations of areas, provides a natural and powerful framework for thinking about brain function and its variation across the brains of individuals, populations , and species. The Connectivity Fingerprint Defined Functional brain organization is often described in terms of the principles of segregation and integration [1]. Segregation means a focus on mapping unique brain areas (see Glossary) and ascribing functions to each, while integration describes the interactions and relationships between remote neural populations that are required for complex behavior. Although both principles on their own are valuable, a full understanding of the brain requires both. Fifteen years ago, Passingham et al. suggested that the concept of a connectivity fingerprint could link these two principles [2]. They proposed that the function of each individual area is determined in the main by its unique set of connections with the rest of the brain. Thus, an area is described within the space of connections. The paper used multidimensional scaling to show that each area occupies a unique place within this space. In the original paper it was suggested, but not proven, that the functions of each area depend on the location of that area in this space. The reasoning was that each area performs a transformation from inputs to outputs and that this transformation depended on the information it received and the areas that it could influence. At the time, connectivity was studied almost exclusively using invasive tracer data in non-human species (Box 1). Although the authors suggested that the same conceptual framework could be applied to data acquired through neuroimaging, the paucity of data at the time meant that this extension of the original hypothesis could not be tested. Since the original paper, the field of connectivity research has taken off in an unprecedented manner [3,4]. Techniques such as diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractog-raphy and resting state functional MRI (fMRI) covariance allow mapping of the connec-tivity of an individual's brain in minutes. Connectivity fingerprints can now be defined easily and related to a wide array of variables given the development of tools for fast data acquisition and advanced connectivity analyses [5-7], and the wide availability of high-quality datasets from both healthy and clinical populations as well as different species [8-10]. Here, we show that the connectivity fingerprint and its relation to function has become a valuable window into understanding the anatomical and functional organization of the brain. It is Highlights The concept of the connectivity fingerprint was described 15 years ago to suggest a crucial relationship between the connections (functional integration) and function (functional segregation) of an area. The advent of neuroimaging now allows for this concept to be applied on a much larger scale, describing brain organization in terms of a connectivity space. Describing brain organization in this space is closer to its functional organization and can predict differences in functional activation and behaviour. By abstracting away into connectivity space one can compare brains across individuals and species. Comparing differences in the connectiv-ity fingerprints of areas or subareal units in terms of gradients, one can investigate which dimension of connectivity space is relevant for understanding particular aspects of brain organization.},

@article{Balsters2020,
	abstract = {With the increasing necessity of animal models in biomedical research, there is a vital need to harmonise findings across species by establishing similarities and differences in rodent and primate neuroanatomy. Using connectivity fingerprint matching, we compared cortico-striatal circuits across humans, non-human primates, and mice using resting-state fMRI data in all species. Our results suggest that the connectivity patterns for the nucleus accumbens and cortico-striatal motor circuits (posterior/lateral putamen) were conserved across species, making them reliable targets for cross-species comparisons. However, a large number of human and macaque striatal voxels were not matched to any mouse cortico-striatal circuit (mouse->human: 85% unassigned; mouse->macaque 69% unassigned; macaque->human; 31% unassigned). These unassigned voxels were localised to the caudate nucleus and anterior putamen, overlapping with executive function and social/language regions of the striatum and connected to prefrontal-projecting cerebellar lobules and anterior prefrontal cortex, forming circuits that seem to be unique for non-human primates and humans.},

@article{Mars2018,
	abstract = {Comparing the brains of related species faces the challenges of establishing homologies whilst accommodating evolutionary specializations. Here we propose a general framework for understanding similarities and differences between the brains of primates. The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologue cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species' blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.},

@article{Mars2013,
	abstract = {The human ability to infer the thoughts and beliefs of others, often referred to as "theory of mind," as well as the predisposition to even consider others, are associated with activity in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) area. Unlike the case of most human brain areas, we have little sense of whether or how TPJ is related to brain areas in other nonhuman primates. It is not possible to address this question by looking for similar task-related activations in nonhuman primates because there is no evidence that nonhuman primates engage in theory-of-mind tasks in the same manner as humans. Here, instead, we explore the relationship by searching for areas in the macaque brain that interact with other macaque brain regions in the same manner as human TPJ interacts with other human brain regions. In other words, we look for brain regions with similar positions within a distributed neural circuit in the two species. We exploited the fact that human TPJ has a unique functional connectivity profile with cortical areas with known homologs in the macaque. For each voxel in the macaque temporal and parietal cortex we evaluated the similarity of its functional connectivity profile to that of human TPJ. We found that areas in the middle part of the superior temporal cortex, often associated with the processing of faces and other social stimuli, have the most similar connectivity profile. These results suggest that macaque face processing areas and human mentalizing areas might have a similar precursor.},
