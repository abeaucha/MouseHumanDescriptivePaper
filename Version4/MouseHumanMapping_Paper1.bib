@article{arnatkeviciute_practical_2019,
	abstract = {The recent availability of comprehensive, brain-wide gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) has opened new opportunities for understanding how spatial variations on molecular scale relate to the macroscopic neuroimaging phenotypes. A rapidly growing body of literature is demonstrating relationships between gene expression and diverse properties of brain structure and function, but approaches for combining expression atlas data with neuroimaging are highly inconsistent, with substantial variations in how the expression data are processed. The degree to which these methodological variations affect findings is unclear. Here, we outline a seven-step analysis pipeline for relating brain-wide transcriptomic and neuroimaging data and compare how different processing choices influence the resulting data. We suggest that studies using the AHBA should work towards a unified data processing pipeline to ensure consistent and reproducible results in this burgeoning field.},

@article{balsters_primate_2020,
	abstract = {With the increasing necessity of animal models in biomedical research, there is a vital need to harmonise findings across species by establishing similarities and differences in rodent and primate neuroanatomy. Using connectivity fingerprint matching, we compared cortico-striatal circuits across humans, non-human primates, and mice using resting-state fMRI data in all species. Our results suggest that the connectivity patterns for the nucleus accumbens and cortico-striatal motor circuits (posterior/lateral putamen) were conserved across species, making them reliable targets for cross-species comparisons. However, a large number of human and macaque striatal voxels were not matched to any mouse cortico-striatal circuit (mouse-{\textgreater}human: 85\% unassigned; mouse-{\textgreater}macaque 69\% unassigned; macaque-{\textgreater}human; 31\% unassigned). These unassigned voxels were localised to the caudate nucleus and anterior putamen, overlapping with executive function and social/language regions of the striatum and connected to prefrontal-projecting cerebellar lobules and anterior prefrontal cortex, forming circuits that seem to be unique for non-human primates and humans.},

@article{mars_whole_2018,
	abstract = {Comparing the brains of related species faces the challenges of establishing homologies whilst accommodating evolutionary specializations. Here we propose a general framework for understanding similarities and differences between the brains of primates. The approach uses white matter blueprints of the whole cortex based on a set of white matter tracts that can be anatomically matched across species. The blueprints provide a common reference space that allows us to navigate between brains of different species, identify homologous cortical areas, or to transform whole cortical maps from one species to the other. Specializations are cast within this framework as deviations between the species' blueprints. We illustrate how this approach can be used to compare human and macaque brains.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of autism populations is confounded by the inherent heterogeneity in the individuals' genetics and environment, two factors difficult to control for. Imaging genetic animal models that recapitulate a mutation associated with autism quantify the impact of genetics on brain morphology and mitigate the confounding factors in human studies. Here, we used MRI to image three genetic mouse models with single mutations implicated in autism: Neuroligin-3 R451C knock-in, Methyl-CpG binding protein-2 (MECP2) 308-truncation and integrin β3 homozygous knockout. This study identified the morphological differences specific to the cerebellum, a structure repeatedly linked to autism in human neuroimaging and postmortem studies. To accomplish a comparative analysis, a segmented cerebellum template was created and used to segment each study image. This template delineated 39 different cerebellar structures. For Neuroligin-3 R451C male mutants, the gray (effect size (ES) = 1.94, FDR q = 0.03) and white (ES = 1.84, q = 0.037) matter of crus II lobule and the gray matter of the paraflocculus (ES = 1.45, q = 0.045) were larger in volume. The MECP2 mutant mice had cerebellar volume changes that increased in scope depending on the genotype: hemizygous males to homozygous females. The integrin β3 mutant mouse had a drastically smaller cerebellum than controls with 28 out of 39 cerebellar structures smaller. These imaging results are discussed in relation to repetitive behaviors, sociability, and learning in the context of autism. This work further illuminates the cerebellum's role in autism.},

It integrates sensory inputs with experiences and memory to produce sophisticated responses to an organism's internal and external environment. While areal patterning of the mouse neocortex has been mapped using histological techniques, the neocortex has not been comprehensively segmented in magnetic resonance images. This study presents a method for systematic segmentation of the C57BL/6J mouse neocortex. We created a minimum deformation atlas, which was hierarchically segmented into 74 neocortical and cortical-related regions, making it the most detailed atlas of the mouse neocortex currently available. In addition, we provide mean volumes and relative intensities for each structure as well as a nomenclature comparison between the two most cited histological atlases of the mouse brain. This MR atlas is available for download, and it should enable researchers to perform automated segmentation in genetic models of cortical disorders.},

This article documents publication trends for these NIH-designated model organisms over the past 40 years. We find that being designated a model organism by the NIH does not guarantee an increasing publication trend. An analysis of model and nonmodel organisms included in GENETICS since 1960 does reveal a sharp decline in the number of publications using nonmodel organisms yet no decline in the overall species diversity. We suggest that organisms with successful publication records tend to share critical characteristics, such as being well developed as standardized, experimental systems and being used by well-organized communities with good networks of exchange and methods of communication.},

@article{fakhry_high-resolution_2015,
	abstract = {The brain is a multi-level system in which the high-level functions are generated by low-level genetic mechanisms. Thus, elucidating the relationship among multiple brain levels via correlative and predictive analytics is an important area in brain research. Currently, studies in multiple species have indicated that the spatiotemporal gene expression patterns are predictive of brain wiring. Specifically, results on the worm Caenorhabditis elegans have shown that the prediction of neuronal connectivity using gene expression signatures yielded statistically significant results. Recent studies on the mammalian brain produced similar results at the coarse regional level. In this study, we provide the first high-resolution, large-scale integrative analysis of the transcriptome and connectome in a single mammalian brain at a fine voxel level. By using the Allen Brain Atlas data, we predict voxel-level brain connectivity based on the gene expressions in the adult mouse brain. We employ regularized models to show that gene expression is predictive of connectivity at the voxel-level with an accuracy of 93\%. We also identify a set of genes playing the most important role in connectivity prediction. We use only this small number of genes to predict the brain wiring with an accuracy over 80\%. We discover that these important genes are enriched in neurons as compared to glia, and they perform connectivity-related functions. We perform several interesting correlative studies to further elucidate the transcriptome--connectome relationship.},

The biochemical content of a neuron is in turn determined by spatiotemporal gene expression and regulation encoded into the genomic regulatory networks. It is thus of particular interest to elucidate the relationship between gene expression patterns and connectivity in the brain. However, systematic studies of this relationship in a single mammalian brain are lacking to date. Here, we investigate this relationship in the mouse brain using the Allen Brain Atlas data. We employ computational models for predicting brain connectivity from gene expression data. In addition to giving competitive predictive performance, these models can rank the genes according to their predictive power. We show that gene expression is predictive of connectivity in the mouse brain when the connectivity signals are discretized. When the expression patterns of 4084 genes are used, we obtain a predictive accuracy of 93\%. Our results also show that a small number of genes can almost give the full predictive power of using thousands of genes. We can achieve a prediction accuracy of 91\% by using only 25 genes. Gene ontology analysis of the highly ranked genes shows that they are enriched for connectivity related processes.},

@article{fulcher_transcriptional_2016,
	abstract = {Connectivity is not distributed evenly throughout the brain. Instead, it is concentrated on a small number of highly connected neural elements that act as network hubs. Across different species and measurement scales, these hubs show dense interconnectivity, forming a core or ``rich club'' that integrates information across anatomically distributed neural systems. Here, we show that projections between connectivity hubs of the mouse brain are both central (i.e., they play an important role in neural communication) and costly (i.e., they extend over long anatomical distances) aspects of network organization that carry a distinctive genetic signature. Analyzing the neuronal connectivity of 213 brain regions and the transcriptional coupling, across 17,642 genes, between each pair of regions, we find that coupling is highest for pairs of connected hubs, intermediate for links between hubs and nonhubs, and lowest for connected pairs of nonhubs. The high transcriptional coupling associated with hub connectivity is driven by genes regulating the oxidative synthesis and metabolism of ATP---the primary energetic currency of neuronal communication. This genetic signature contrasts that identified for neuronal connectivity in general, which is driven by genes regulating neuronal, synaptic, and axonal structure and function. Our findings establish a direct link between molecular function and the large-scale topology of neuronal connectivity, showing that brain hubs display a tight coordination of gene expression, often over long anatomical distances, that is intimately related to the metabolic requirements of these highly active network elements.},

Here we report the topographic similarity of large-scale gradients in cytoarchitecture, gene expression, interneuron cell densities, and long-range axonal connectivity, which vary from primary sensory to prefrontal areas of mouse cortex, highlighting an underappreciated spatial dimension of mouse cortical specialization. Using the T1-weighted:T2-weighted (T1w:T2w) magnetic resonance imaging map as a common spatial reference for comparison across species, we report interspecies agreement in a range of large-scale cortical gradients, including a significant correspondence between gene transcriptional maps in mouse cortex with their human orthologs in human cortex, as well as notable interspecies differences. Our results support the view of systematic structural variation across cortical areas as a core organizational principle that may underlie hierarchical specialization in mammalian brains.},

Here we extend this type of approach to examine complex patterns of gene expression in the rodent brain in the context of regional brain connectivity and differences in cellular populations. Using multiple large-scale data sets obtained from public sources, we identified two novel patterns of mouse brain gene expression showing a strong degree of anti-correlation, and relate this to multiple data modalities including macroscale connectivity. We found that these signatures are associated with differences in expression of neuronal and oligodendrocyte markers, suggesting they reflect regional differences in cellular populations. We also find that the expression level of these genes is correlated with connectivity degree, with regions expressing the neuron-enriched pattern having more incoming and outgoing connections with other regions. Our results exemplify what is possible when increasingly detailed large-scale cell- and gene-level data sets are integrated with connectivity data.},

@article{wang_subplate_2010,
	abstract = {The subplate is a largely transient zone containing precocious neurons involved in several key steps of cortical development. The majority of subplate neurons form a compact layer in mouse, but are dispersed throughout a much larger zone in the human. In rodent, subplate neurons are among the earliest born neocortical cells, whereas in primate, neurons are added to the subplate throughout cortical neurogenesis. Magnetic resonance imaging and histochemical studies show that the human subplate grows in size until the end of the second trimester. Previous microarray experiments in mice have shown several genes that are specifically expressed in the subplate layer of the rodent dorsal cortex. Here we examined the human subplate for some of these markers. In the human dorsal cortex, connective tissue growth factor-positive neurons can be seen in the ventricular zone at 15--22 postconceptional weeks (PCW) (most at 17 PCW) and are present in the subplate at 22 PCW. The nuclear receptor-related 1 protein is mostly expressed in the subplate in the dorsal cortex, but also in lower layer 6 in the lateral and perirhinal cortex, and can be detected from 12 PCW. Our results suggest that connective tissue growth factor- and nuclear receptor-related 1-positive cells are two distinct cell populations of the human subplate. Furthermore, our microarray analysis in rodent suggested that subplate neurons produce plasma proteins. Here we demonstrate that the human subplate also expresses a2zinc-binding globulin and Alpha-2-HeremansSchmid glycoprotein ⁄ human fetuin. In addition, the established subplate neuron marker neuropeptide Y is expressed superficially, whereas potassium ⁄ chloride co-transporter (KCC2)-positive neurons are localized in the deep subplate at 16 PCW. These observations imply that the human subplate shares gene expression patterns with rodent, but is more compartmentalized into superficial and deep sublayers. This increased complexity of the human subplate may contribute to differential vulnerability in response to hypoxia ⁄ ischaemia across the depth of the cortex. Combining knowledge of cell-type specific subplate gene expression with modern imaging methods will enable a better understanding of neuropathologies involving the subplate.},

The relationship between it and the vlFC of other primates has therefore been the subject of particular speculation. We used a combination of structural and functional neuroimaging methods to identify key components of human vlFC. We compared how vlFC areas interacted with other brain areas in 25 humans and 25 macaques using the same methods. We identified a core set of 11 vlFC components that interacted in similar ways with similar distributed circuits in both species and, in addition, one distinctively human component in ventrolateral frontal pole. Fundamental differences in interactions with posterior auditory association areas in the two species were also present---these were ubiquitous throughout posterior human vlFC but channeled to different frontal regions in monkeys. Finally, there were some differences in interregional interactions within vlFC in the two species.},

@article{richiardi_correlated_2015,
	abstract = {During rest, brain activity is synchronized between different regions widely distributed throughout the brain, forming functional networks. However, the molecular mechanisms supporting functional connectivity remain undefined. We show that functional brain networks defined with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can be recapitulated by using measures of correlated gene expression in a post mortem brain tissue data set. The set of 136 genes we identify is significantly enriched for ion channels. Polymorphisms in this set of genes significantly affect resting-state functional connectivity in a large sample of healthy adolescents. Expression levels of these genes are also significantly associated with axonal connectivity in the mouse. The results provide convergent, multimodal evidence that resting-state functional networks correlate with the orchestrated activity of dozens of genes linked to ion channel activity and synaptic function.},

	abstract = {Finding links between genes and structural connectivity is of the utmost importance for unravelling the underlying mechanism of the brain connectome. In this study we identify links between the gene expression and the axonal projection density in the mouse brain, by applying a modified version of the Linked ICA method to volumetric data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science for identifying independent sources of information that link both modalities at the voxel level. We performed separate analyses on sets of projections from the visual cortex, the caudoputamen and the midbrain reticular nucleus, and we determined those brain areas, injections and genes that were most involved in independent components that link both gene expression and projection density data, while we validated their biological context through enrichment analysis. We identified representative and literature-validated cortico-midbrain and cortico-striatal projections, whose gene subsets were enriched with annotations for neuronal and synaptic function and related developmental and metabolic processes. The results were highly reproducible when including all available projections, as well as consistent with factorisations obtained using the Dictionary Learning and Sparse Coding technique. Hence, Linked ICA yielded reproducible independent components that were preserved under increasing data variance. Taken together, we have developed and validated a novel paradigm for linking gene expression and structural projection patterns in the mouse mesoconnectome, which can power future studies aiming to relate genes to brain function.},

A notable shift has taken place over the last two decades, with mice taking a more and more prominent role in biomedical science compared to rats. This shift was primarily instigated by the availability of a much larger genetic toolbox for mice, particularly embryonicstem-cell-based targeting technology for gene disruption. With the recent emergence of tools for altering the rat genome, notably genome-editing technologies, the technological gap between the two organisms is closing, and it is becoming more important to consider the physiological, anatomical, biochemical and pharmacological differences between rats and mice when choosing the right model system for a specific biological question. The aim of this short review and accompanying poster is to highlight some of the most important differences, and to discuss their impact on studies of human diseases, with a special focus on neuropsychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex has been implicated in a variety of cognitive and executive processes, including working memory, decision-making, inhibitory response control, attentional set-shifting and the temporal integration of voluntary behaviour. This article reviews current progress in our understanding of the rodent prefrontal cortex, especially evidence for functional divergence of the anatomically distinct sub-regions of the rat prefrontal cortex. Recent findings suggest clear distinctions between the dorsal (precentral and anterior cingulate) and ventral (prelimbic, infralimbic and medial orbital) sub-divisions of the medial prefrontal cortex, and between the orbitofrontal cortex (ventral orbital, ventrolateral orbital, dorsal and ventral agranular cortices) and the adjacent medial wall of the prefrontal cortex. The dorso-medial prefrontal cortex is implicated in memory for motor responses, including response selection, and the temporal processing of information. Ventral regions of the medial prefrontal cortex are implicated in interrelated `supervisory' attentional functions, including attention to stimulus features and task contingencies (or action--outcome rules), attentional set-shifting, and behavioural flexibility. The orbitofrontal cortex is implicated in lowerorder discriminations, including reversal of stimulus--reward associations (reversal learning), and choice involving delayed reinforcement. It is anticipated that a greater understanding of the prefrontal cortex will come from using tasks that load specific cognitive and executive processes, in parallel with discovering new ways of manipulating the different sub-regions and neuromodulatory systems of the prefrontal cortex.},

@article{guma_regional_2018,
	abstract = {Background: Neuroanatomical alterations are well established in patients suffering from schizophrenia, however the extent to which these changes are attributable to illness, antipsychotic drugs (APDs), or their interaction is unclear. APDs have been extremely effective for treatment of positive symptoms in major psychotic disorders. Their therapeutic effects are mediated, in part, through blockade of D2-like dopamine (DA) receptors, i.e. the D2, D3 and D4 dopamine receptors. Furthermore, the dependency of neuroanatomical change on DA system function and D2-like receptors has yet to be explored.
Methods: We undertook a preclinical longitudinal study to examine the effects of typical (haloperidol (HAL)) and atypical (clozapine (CLZ)) APDs in wild type (WT) and dopamine D2 knockout (D2KO) mice over 9-weeks using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Results: Chronic typical APD administration in WT mice was associated with reductions in total brain (p ¼ 0.009) and prelimbic area (PL) (p ¼ 0.02) volumes following 9-weeks, and an increase in striatal volume (p ¼ 0.04) after six weeks. These APD-induced changes were not present in D2KOs, where, at baseline, we observed significantly smaller overall brain volume (p {\textless} 0.01), thinner cortices (q {\textless} 0.05), and enlarged striata (q {\textless} 0.05). Stereological assessment revealed increased glial density in PL area of HAL treated wild types. Interestingly, in WT and D2KO mice, chronic CLZ administration caused more limited changes in brain structure.
Conclusions: Our results present evidence for the role of D2 DA receptors in structural alterations induced by the administration of the typical APD HAL and that chronic administration of CLZ has a limited influence on brain structure.},

@article{pagani_mtor-related_2021,
	abstract = {Abstract
            Postmortem studies have revealed increased density of excitatory synapses in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with a putative link to aberrant mTOR-dependent synaptic pruning. ASD is also characterized by atypical macroscale functional connectivity as measured with resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI). These observations raise the question of whether excess of synapses causes aberrant functional connectivity in ASD. Using rsfMRI, electrophysiology and in silico modelling in Tsc2 haploinsufficient mice, we show that mTOR-dependent increased spine density is associated with ASD -like stereotypies and cortico-striatal hyperconnectivity. These deficits are completely rescued by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR. Notably, we further demonstrate that children with idiopathic ASD exhibit analogous cortical-striatal hyperconnectivity, and document that this connectivity fingerprint is enriched for ASD-dysregulated genes interacting with mTOR or Tsc2. Finally, we show that the identified transcriptomic signature is predominantly expressed in a subset of children with autism, thereby defining a segregable autism subtype. Our findings causally link mTOR-related synaptic pathology to large-scale network aberrations, revealing a unifying multi-scale framework that mechanistically reconciles developmental synaptopathy and functional hyperconnectivity in autism.},

@article{wolf_gene_2011,
	abstract = {The putative link between gene expression of brain regions and their neural connectivity patterns is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here this question is addressed in the first large scale study of a prototypical mammalian rodent brain, using a combination of rat brain regional connectivity data with gene expression of the mouse brain. Remarkably, even though this study uses data from two different rodent species (due to the data limitations), we still find that the connectivity of the majority of brain regions is highly predictable from their gene expression levels--the outgoing (incoming) connectivity is successfully predicted for 73\% (56\%) of brain regions, with an overall fairly marked accuracy level of 0.79 (0.83). Many genes are found to play a part in predicting both the incoming and outgoing connectivity (241 out of the 500 top selected genes, p-value,1e-5). Reassuringly, the genes previously known from the literature to be involved in axon guidance do carry significant information about regional brain connectivity. Surveying the genes known to be associated with the pathogenesis of several brain disorders, we find that those associated with schizophrenia, autism and attention deficit disorder are the most highly enriched in the connectivity-related genes identified here. Finally, we find that the profile of functional annotation groups that are associated with regional connectivity in the rodent is significantly correlated with the annotation profile of genes previously found to determine neural connectivity in C. elegans (Pearson correlation of 0.24, p,1e-6 for the outgoing connections and 0.27, p,1e-5 for the incoming). Overall, the association between connectivity and gene expression in a specific extant rodent species' brain is likely to be even stronger than found here, given the limitations of current data.},

@article{mandino_triple-network_2021,
	abstract = {The triple-network model of psychopathology is a framework to explain the functional and structural neuroimaging phenotypes of psychiatric and neurological disorders. It describes the interactions within and between three distributed networks: the salience, default-mode, and central executive networks. These have been associated with brain disorder traits in patients. Homologous networks have been proposed in animal models, but their integration into a triple-network organization has not yet been determined. Using resting-state datasets, we demonstrate conserved spatio-temporal properties between triple-network elements in human, macaque, and mouse. The model predictions were also shown to apply in a mouse model for depression. To validate spatial homologies, we developed a data-driven approach to convert mouse brain maps into human standard coordinates. Finally, using high-resolution viral tracers in the mouse, we refined an anatomical model for these networks and validated this using optogenetics in mice and tractography in humans. Unexpectedly, we find serotonin involvement within the salience rather than the default-mode network. Our results support the existence of a triple-network system in the mouse that shares properties with that of humans along several dimensions, including a disease condition. Finally, we demonstrate a method to humanize mouse brain networks that opens doors to fully data-driven trans-species comparisons.},

New highthroughput methods and data-sharing initiatives have resulted in the availability of large, digital data sets containing many types of data from ever more species.

The multimodality of the data allows vertical translations, which are comparisons of different aspects of brain organization within a single species and across scales. Horizontal translations compare particular aspects of brain organization across species, often by building abstract feature spaces. Combining vertical and horizontal translations allows for more sophisticated comparisons, including relating principles of brain organization across species by contrasting horizontal translations, and for making formal predictions of unobtainable data based on observed results in a model species.},

@article{barron_cross-species_2021,
	abstract = {Neuroscience has seen substantial development in non-invasive methods available for investigating the living human brain. However, these tools are limited to coarse macroscopic measures of neural activity that aggregate the diverse responses of thousands of cells. To access neural activity at the cellular and circuit level, researchers instead rely on invasive recordings in animals. Recent advances in invasive methods now permit large-scale recording and circuit-level manipulations with exquisite spatio-temporal precision. Yet, there has been limited progress in relating these microcircuit measures to complex cognition and behaviour observed in humans. Contemporary neuroscience thus faces an explanatory gap between macroscopic descriptions of the human brain and microscopic descriptions in animal models. To close the explanatory gap, we propose adopting a cross-species approach. Despite dramatic differences in the size of mammalian brains, this approach is broadly justified by preserved homology. Here, we outline a three-armed approach for effective cross-species investigation that highlights the need to translate different measures of neural activity into a common space. We discuss how a cross-species approach has the potential to transform basic neuroscience while also benefiting neuropsychiatric drug development where clinical translation has, to date, seen minimal success.

In this report we focus on the manifestation of this cross-modal compensation at the cortical level. Cyto- and myeloarchitectural analyses of the occipital area showed that despite the almost total blindness of the mole rat this area has retained the organization of a typical mammalian primary visual cortex. Application of the metabolic marker 2-deoxyglucose and electrophysiological recording of evoked field potentials and single-unit activity disclosed that a considerable part of this area is activated by auditory stimuli. Previous neuronal tracing studies had revealed the origin of the bulk of this auditory input to be the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus which itself receives auditory input from the inferior colliculus.},

More importantly, Brodmann provided a comparative neuroanatomical approach and discussed ontogenetic and pathological aspects as well as structural--functional correlations.

@article{ren_connectivity-based_2019,
	abstract = {The cerebellum is traditionally well known for its role in motor learning and coordination. Recently, it is recognized that the function of the cerebellum is highly diverse and extends to non-motor domains, such as working memory, emotion and language. The diversity of the cerebellum can be appreciated by examining its extensive connectivity to the cerebral regions selective for both motor and cognitive functions. Importantly, the pattern of cerebro-cerebellar connectivity is specific and distinct to different cerebellar subregions. Therefore, to understand the cerebellum and the various functions it involves, it is essential to identify and differentiate its subdivisions. However, most studies are still referring the cerebellum as one brain structure or by its gross anatomical subdivisions, which does not necessarily reflect the functional mapping of the cerebellum. We here employed a data-driven method to generate a functional connectivity-based parcellation of the cerebellum. Our results demonstrated that functional connectivity-based atlas is superior to existing atlases in regards to cluster homogeneity, accuracy of functional connectivity representation and individual identification. Furthermore, our functional atlas improves statistical results of task fMRI analyses, as compared to the standard voxel-based approach and existing atlases. Our detailed functional parcellation provides a valuable tool for elucidating the functional diversity and connectivity of the cerebellum as well as its network relationships with the whole brain.},

Successful integration of these data requires a standard 3D reference atlas. Here, we present the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) as such a resource. We constructed an average template brain at 10 μm voxel resolution by interpolating high resolution in-plane serial two-photon tomography images with 100 μm z-sampling from 1,675 young adult C57BL/6J mice. Then, using multimodal reference data, we parcellated the entire brain directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 329 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. CCFv3 can be used to analyze, visualize and integrate multimodal and multiscale datasets in 3D, and is openly accessible (https://atlas.brain-map.org).,

	abstract = {L\$\_2\$ regularization and weight decay regularization are equivalent for standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but as we demonstrate this is {\textbackslash}emph\{not\} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms, such as Adam. While common implementations of these algorithms employ L\$\_2\$ regularization (often calling it "weight decay" in what may be misleading due to the inequivalence we expose), we propose a simple modification to recover the original formulation of weight decay regularization by {\textbackslash}emph\{decoupling\} the weight decay from the optimization steps taken w.r.t. the loss function. We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard SGD and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with SGD with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter). Our proposed decoupled weight decay has already been adopted by many researchers, and the community has implemented it in TensorFlow and PyTorch; the complete source code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/loshchil/AdamW-and-SGDW},
