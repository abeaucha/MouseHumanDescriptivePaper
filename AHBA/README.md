# Allen Human Brain Atlas

This directory contains scripts to download and process the microarray data sets from the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://human.brain-map.org) (AHBA). The data are downloaded using the [Allen Brain Atlas API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/) and processed to create sample-wise gene expression matrices and neuroanatomical trees.
