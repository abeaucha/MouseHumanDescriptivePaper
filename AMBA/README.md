# Allen Mouse Brain Atlas

This directory contains scripts to download and process the in-situ hybridization data sets from the [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org) (AMBA). The data are downloaded using the [Allen Brain Atlas API](http://help.brain-map.org/display/api/) and processed to create voxel-wise gene expression matrices and neuroanatomical trees.
